# go-aws-creds

Rewrite of a [gist](https://gist.github.com/JonMerlevede/932726f3388176f7e5f731be6c5f8710) embedded by [Jonathan Merlevede](https://medium.com/@jonathan.merlevede) in his [post on AWS credential process authentication](https://medium.com/datamindedbe/aws-web-identity-token-authentication-in-legacy-applications-fcae7520020).

This code is a complete rewrite to eliminate use of modules outside the Go Standard Library.

The current code compiles, but is untested.
